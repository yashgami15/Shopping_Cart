# Online Shopping Cart (E-Commerce Website)
This is an E-Commerce Website built for selling electronics products online.

# About

In this project, a user can visit the websites, register, and log in to the website. They can check all the products available for shopping, filter and search items based on different categories, and then add to a cart. They can add multiple items to the cart and plus or minus the quantity in the cart. Once the cart is updated, the user can proceed to checkout and click the credit card payment details to proceed. Once the payment is successful the orders will be placed and users will be able to see the order details in the orders section along with the shipping status of the product.

The admin also plays an important role in this project as the admin is the one responsible for adding any product to the store, updating the items, removing the item from the store as well as managing the inventory. The admin can see all the product orders placed and mark them as shipped or delivered based on the conditions.

One of the best functionalities that the projects include is mailing the customers, so once a user registers to the website, they will receive a mail for the successful registration to the website, and along with that whenever a user orders any product or the product got shipped from the store, then the user will also receive the email for its confirmation.
Sometimes, if the user tries to add any item that is out of stock, then they will get an email once the item is available again the stock.
